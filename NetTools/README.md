NetTools
===========

Basic php scripts for various tasks


Description
-------------
This script is not a finished tool yet. I am still working on it to make it take input and then run those commands on custom website/IP. Currently working on input senitization so it can not be affected by any type of injection attack. 

That being said it is just a basic set of PHP web pages that run the command using an API and then display result, nothing fancy, nothing new. Just wanted to expose myself to little bit of PHP.


Usage
-------------
- Open a terminal, type `git clone https://github.com/TheCyberBlock/CySec-Projects.git` and press enter
- Go to `NetTools` folder by typing `cd NetTools`
- Move all the `.php` files from this folder to php hosting server by running `mv *.php <Any Folder On Server>` in terminal
- Visit the webpage by puting the file path in web browser


Requirements
-------------
- WebServer running PHP (XAMPP, WAMP)
- Git
